## Environment Variables

Env vars can come from multiple sources. Merge priority (highest wins):

1. Step `env` (inline YAML)
2. Step `envFile` (per-step dotenv file)
3. CLI `--env-file` (global, applied to all steps)
4. Kit defaults

## Mounts

Mount host directories read-only into containers:

```yaml
mounts:
  - host: src/app        # relative path (from pipeline file directory)
    container: /app      # absolute path in container
```

Rules: `host` must be relative (may use `..` to reach sibling directories, but cannot escape `process.cwd()`), `container` must be absolute and cannot contain `..`. Containers cannot modify mounted host files.

## Sources

Copy host directories into the container's writable layer:

```yaml
sources:
  - host: src/app
    container: /app
```

Same path rules as mounts (`host` may use `..` but cannot escape `process.cwd()`). Files are snapshotted at step start. The container can create files alongside sources (e.g. `node_modules`).

**When to use `sources` vs `mounts`**:
- `sources`: step needs to write alongside source files (install deps, generate build artifacts)
- `mounts`: read-only access is sufficient (config, static data)

## Caches

Persistent read-write directories shared across steps and executions:

```yaml
caches:
  - name: pnpm-store
    path: /root/.local/share/pnpm/store
  - name: build-cache
    path: /tmp/cache
```

Caches are workspace-scoped (not global). Common uses: package manager caches, build caches, downloaded assets. Set `exclusive: true` on a cache to acquire an in-memory mutex during the setup phase, preventing concurrent writes from parallel steps.

## Setup Phase

Optional pre-execution phase for dependency installation. Runs before the main `cmd` in the same container.

```yaml
setup:
  cmd: [sh, -c, "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl"]
  caches:
    - name: apt-cache
      path: /var/cache/apt
      exclusive: true
  allowNetwork: true
```

- `cmd`: command to run during setup (required if setup is present)
- `caches`: caches needed during setup; supports `exclusive: true` for mutex locking
- `allowNetwork`: enable network during setup even if the run phase is isolated

Built-in kits produce a `setup` phase automatically when `install` is enabled. For kit steps, user-level `setup` merges with kit defaults (user `cmd` overrides, caches merge by name, user `allowNetwork` overrides).

## Conditional Steps

Use `if` with a [JEXL](https://github.com/TomFrost/Jexl) expression evaluated against environment variables via `env`:

```yaml
- id: deploy
  if: env.NODE_ENV == "production"
  uses: shell
  with:
    run: echo "Deploying..."

- id: notify
  if: env.CI
  uses: shell
  with:
    run: echo "Running in CI"
```

When a condition is false, the step is skipped. Steps with required (non-optional) inputs depending on a skipped step are also skipped.

## Caching and Workspaces

Workspace ID is determined by (in priority order):
1. `--workspace` CLI flag
2. Pipeline `id` (explicit or derived from `name`)

Steps are skipped when their fingerprint (SHA256 of image + cmd + setup cmd + resolved env including `envFile` and `--env-file` + sorted inputs + mounts) hasn't changed since the last successful run. Use `--force` to bypass.

## `.pipex.yml` Configuration

Place a `.pipex.yml` file at the project root:

```yaml
kits:
  geo: ./kits/geo.js        # kit alias → local file or npm specifier
  ml: @myorg/pipex-kit-ml

detach: true                 # default execution mode: daemon (background)
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kits` | Record<string, string> | Kit aliases (name → file path or npm specifier) |
| `detach` | boolean | When `true`, `pipex run` launches a daemon and returns immediately (default: `false`) |
